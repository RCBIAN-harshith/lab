â€¢ **Program2 â€“ A Simple Java Learning Project**

  Welcome to **Program2** â€” a small, straightforward Java project I built to explore how Java and Maven work together. Think of it as a hands-on guide for understanding the basics of structuring, building, and testing a Java application.

â€¢ **Why This Project Exists**

  I created this project as a way to:
  - Learn how Maven helps manage Java projects.
  - Get comfortable with writing and running unit tests using JUnit.
  - Understand what happens behind the scenes when a Java project is built.
  - Have a clean, minimal setup to refer back to or build upon in the future.

â€¢ **What It Actually Does**

  At its core, this project includes a simple Java class that performs a basic function (like printing something or doing a small task). It also comes with a test class to make sure the main code works as expected.

  It doesn't try to do anything fancy â€” the goal is clarity over complexity.

â€¢ **Who It's For**

  This project is great for:
  - Anyone new to Java or Maven
  - Students or self-learners who want a practical example
  - Developers looking for a basic Java project template
  - People who learn best by doing, not just reading docs

â€¢ **What You Can Learn From It**

  - How to organize a Java project using Maven
  - How Maven builds and packages your code
  - How to write simple unit tests and view the results
  - Where files like compiled classes, reports, and `.jar` files go

â€¢ **Final Thoughts**

  **Program2** is a learning tool â€” nothing more, nothing less. Itâ€™s a clean, no-fluff example of how to start a Java project the right way, using tools that professionals use. If you're starting out or just brushing up, I hope this helps!
